        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>When we think of wild horses, or mustangs, we probably imagine them galloping across the plains of North America, wild and free. Their complex relationship with the local environment, humans, and human-made systems is woven into the history of this country.</p>

        <h3>History</h3>

        <p>When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velma_Bronn_Johnston">Velma Johnston</a> almost single-handedly persuaded Congress to pass the <a href="https://www.blm.gov/sites/default/files/programs_wildhorse_history_doc1.pdf">Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971</a>, her goal to protect an icon of the American West made a major step forward.</p>

        <p>The Act holds the federal government responsible for an estimated 33,000 wild horses roaming on public lands in the western United States. Unfortunately, this is a complicated task. Mustang populations can grow rapidly and compete with cattle and wildlife for increasingly scarce resources. Public desire to adopt old horses is limited at best. Contraceptive efforts to humanely control populations have largely failed. U.S. law effectively precludes euthanizing them, or selling them to anyone who would. Even so, many want the horses left untouched and unregulated, placing them into conflict with land owners, farmers, and property owners.<sup><a href="#fn1" rel="fn" id="fn1r">1</a></p></sip>

        <h3>The Players</h3>

        <h4>Bureau of Land Management</h4>

        <p>Under a 1971 law, the <a href="https://www.blm.gov/">Bureau of Land Management</a> (BLM) is supposed to protect these horses and make sure their numbers don’t fluctuate to the point where they’re destroying the ecosystem or dying of starvation.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately the tactics used by the BLM have been controversial. Compounding this, the BLM’s record-keeping has been substandard.</p>

        <h4>Wild Horse Activists</h4>

        <p>Websites like <a href="https://americanwildhorsecampaign.org/">Wild Horse Preservation</a> have three main premises:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The BLM cannot competently manage wild horses</li>
          <li>The BLM is an anti-horse, pro-rancher organization</li>
          <li>Wild horse populations can regulate themselves without human interference</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Purpose of this Website</h3>

        <p>We want to help readers arrive at informed decisions. The topic is controversial and hits home for many Americans: how can we best protect the iconic American wild horses–as well as the environment on which everyone depends?</p>

        <p>Let's review the facts presented on the <a href="https://americanwildhorsecampaign.org/">American Wild Horse Preservation website</a>. We'll use several scientific studies to analyze these facts, as well as documents straight from the source of the BLM or other government websites.</a></p>

        <h2>Wild Horse Preservation Fact Check</h2>
      </article>
    </div>
    <section class="intro">
      <article>
        
        <p>Below we'll explore discrepancies between the Wild Horse Preservation website, one of the leading wild horse groups, and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). First, we quote the Wild Horse Preservation website, then we compare it to data found on the BLM website, government websites, and the National Academy of Sciences 2013 study.<p> 

        <p>The National Academy of Sciences study reviewed the BLM&rsquo;s wild horse and burro management issues over a two-year period; this study is key to this report because it was completed recently by an unbiased committee</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Wild Horses roaming the West have decreased in population by 98% since the late 1800s.</p>

      <aside>
        <p>We don&rsquo;t know how many wild horses there were in the 1800s.</p>
        <div class="conclusion">
          <p>The reduction in population over the last 150 years is almost certainly due to a variety of factors rather than BLM policies.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>In 1971, when Congress passed the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act, &lsquo;these animals&rsquo; were found roaming across 53.8 million acres known as Herd Areas, of which 42.4 million acres were under the BLM&rsquo;s jurisdiction. Today the BLM manages wild horses and burros in 179 subsets of these Herd Areas (known as Herd Management Areas) that comprise 31.6 million acres, of which 26.9 million acres are under BLM management.</p>

        <p>As of January 2015, there are 47,925 wild horses and burros fed and cared for at short-term corrals and long-term pastures. (Specifically, there are 15,574 horses and 923 burros in short-term holding <a href="http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/prog/whbprogram/history_and_facts/quick_facts.html">for a total of 16,497 animals</a> and 31,428 horses in long-term pastures.) &mdash; <a href="http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/prog/whbprogram/history_and_facts/quick_facts.html">BLM</a></p>

        <p>Their numbers are a slightly different, but using the National Academies report and the BLMs own figures the math roughly works out:</p>

        <pre>(47,925 + 34,206) / 8 * 5 = 51,331</pre>

        <p>According to the Government Accountability Office, Gathers result in few deaths:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Although BLM&rsquo;s controls are designed to enhance the safety of wild horses and burros during gather operations, some animals are accidentally killed in the course of gathers or are euthanized because of ill health or prior injury. Six of the 10 BLM state offices reported data about the number of animals that die as a result of their gather operations. Data collected from 6 of the 10 states from fiscal years 2005 through 2007 indicate that, of the 24,855 animals removed from these states during this period, about 1.2 percent were either euthanized or died accidentally (see table 13). Horses and burros sometimes die due to accidents during gather operations on the range or after they are brought to the holding pens. For example, wild horses will sometimes panic and break their necks against capture pens. Animals found with conditions that make it unlikely they will be able to live their life without significant pain, such as lameness or club feet, are euthanized.</p>
