### Building an Ethical Framework with Executives

I partnered with C-level executives to define needs and articulate beliefs, creating an investment strategy for nonprofit. 72-page workbook has guided board investments since 2019 and used to fund 55+ charities. Workbook built in [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) for maintainability and cross-referencing.

In order to succeed at this project I grounded all work in the three broad ethical theories (Consequentialist, Non-consequentialist, Agent-centered), keeping things high-level and objective for the team. The document was functionally organized by the nonprofit's areas of concern:

1. Animal Welfare 
2. The Environment 
3. The Arts

Where possible, I charted out certifications and standards to establish objective criteria or referenced published and peer-reviewed sustainable standards for investment. I then worked with the team to outline steps for choosing whether to fund a charity. As with many executive documents, I framed the lay of the land and left the choice in their hands; after all, the document is a tool to help with decision-making rather than a directive on how to make choices.

> ##### Step 1: Certification  
> We can see whether the organization is certified in any of the following recognized programs:  
> 1. Certified Humane Program  
> 2. AWA Program  
> 3. Global Animal Partnership   
> 4. National Organic Program   
> 5. American Humane Certified  

> ##### Step 2: Track the Issue at Hand
> We can also use any of the Certification Tables below to pin down the specific animal welfare issue (or issues) most pertinent to the cause at hand.  
> For example, if litter conditions for chickens are important you, you might check the table below and see that the Certified Humane Program requires litter management, whereas Global Animal Partnership does not.

For areas such as art where there are no measured standards, the framweork builds on a starting point founded in education and strengthening diverse communities. 

Finally, the guide contains appendices 

#### Executive Communication Plan

I use the skills I acquired as a certified project manager to build productive working relationships with executives, focusing on:

1. Anticipate concerns & give regular updates
2. Tailor communication for each executive
3. Keep the bottom line up front
4. Messages no longer than a small phone screen
5. Follow up on questions as a priority
6. Listen carefully

#### Funding Charities since 2015

This is one of my favorite projects: it was quite sweeping in scope and required a lot of finesse, while giving me the opportunity to gain gain a deeper understanding of animal welfare, sustainability, and how nuanced issues like animal testing are. The output of this project, more funded charities and a clear direction for a team, is something that I am proud of.
