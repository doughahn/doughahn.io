### Tenant Handbooks for Jewelbox properties

Cross-collaborating with building engineers, property managers, legal, and other key stakeholders, I authored, published, and maintained tenant handbooks for significant properties in the Bay Area. These assets, about $300M, were a significant portion of the company&rsquo;s portfolio. Tenant handbooks were written for:

1. The Bently Reserve
1. Belvedere Place
1. Bently Nob Hill
1. 240 Stockton Street, San francisco

These documents covered local amenities; policies and procedures hor elevator usage,hazardous material, insurance requirements, moving, maintenance, subtenants, and more; security, key policy, and access control; emergency policies and commercial tenant responsibilities, life safety systems; and amenities such as bicycle policy, e-waste recycling, and environmental safety measures.
