### Changing company culture for the better

I spearheaded the creation of an extensive documentation website using custom HTML and CSS. This resource provided a comprehensive exploration of the history, animal rights, welfare issues, and the Bureau of Land Management concerns specific to the American West.

I personally handled the design and coding of the site, which was a vital tool in guiding the company&rsquo;s interactions with government officials and in shaping its policy both in the field and in the office.

Moreover, this documentation served a critical purpose in countering misinformation circulating within the company. By meticulously curating information from multiple sources, the website encourages a culture of decisions based on critical thinking and research.

Recognizing the need for a shift in company culture, I put considerable effort into designing a visually appealing, mobile-friendly, and engaging documentation site.
