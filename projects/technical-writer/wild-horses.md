### Changing Company Culture for the Better

I spearheaded the creation of an extensive documentation website using custom HTML and CSS. This resource provided a comprehensive exploration of the history, animal rights, and welfare issues that the Bureau of Land Management grapples with in the American West.

I personally handled the design and coding of the site, which was a vital tool in guiding the company's interactions with government officials and in shaping its policy stance both in the field and in the office.

Moreover, this documentation served a critical purpose in countering misinformation circulating within the company. By meticulously curating information from multiple sources, the website encourages a culture of decisions based on critical thinking and research.

Recognizing the need for a shift in company culture, I put considerable effort into designing a visually appealing, mobile-friendly, and engaging documentation site.
