### Self-Guided Onboarding

I streamlined the onboarding processes for SaaS developers by implementing virtualized, sanitized environments. Collaborating with senior engineers, we drafted and published  workflows and built automated scripts to bootstrap and sanitize information using Vagrant, allowing developers to work on applications with highly sensitive data such as HR and compliance. 

This resulted in significant improvements in the onboarding process. I wrote and maintained the site using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) and the [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) theme.
