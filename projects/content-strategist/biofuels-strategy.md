### Building a Biofuels Brand

I collaborated with the founders, senior leadership, and key stakeholders to distill research and vision into a core strategy statement that helped guide cross-functional teams. By effectively presenting these findings to the team, I was able to help leadership establish a shared vision and a strategy that steered the team through the entirety of the business development cycle.

In addition, I acquired buy-in and led a content audit with SMEs to identify weak points and target high-value items that to business value immediately. This audit was bolstered with insights gleaned from Google Analytics and market research. Our output included a content calendar and new governance policies.

Finally, I organized [Page Description Diagram](https://uxmag.com/articles/re-introducing-page-description-diagrams) workshops to prioritize user needs while focusing on taxonomy. This put design decisions where they belonged: in the hands of the web and UX professional.
