### Building buy-in fast & iterating to build outcomes

Bently Enterprises wanted to enhance cross-functional learning opportunities across all levels of the company, capitalizing on an opportunity to help employees grow their careers as virtual learning took off. They required delivery in under 1 month. 

After being designated the project manager on the project charter, I opened a discovery session with the HR and IT teams to discuss current learning initiatives at the company, review technologies used, and define scope for an  (minimum viable product). As part of the scope statement, I created a [low-fi interactive prototype](https://codepen.io/doughahn/live/WNGeRVJ/c39f3ee728cb159b86a01723c0b7ebfd) for stakeholders of the appâ€™s proposed functionality using CodePen HTML, CSS, JS and various libraries:

Technology and HR were using Captivate to create classes, but were unsure how to actually enroll employees in courses and track engagement.

#### Scope Statement

The following scope statement was shared with the team: 

> __Goal: __  Generate buy-in by broadcasting learning opportunities to employees. 
> __Deliverable:__ Design and code a SaaS app that integrates with existing company suite of apps, with functionality based on the prototype.
> - All employees should have access to view and sign up for any upcoming training, fulfilling the cross-functionality requirement. 
> - All trainings should be searchable and filterable by date and department.
> - All managers should be able to schedule trainings, allowing knowledge to be shared.  
> - Required training (e.g. harassment/safety) should stand out. 
> - Attendee info (name, email) should be exportable as CSV by HR-level users.

#### MVP Deliverable

The deliverable was created using a simple interface. Features such as exporting attendees and adding sessions were permissions-based.

#### Iterations

After launch the HR and IT teams curated a backlog under my guidance, prioritizing features to include based on discovery sessions as well as developer capacity and availability. 

Backlog items included a dynamic page linking learning partners such as Berkeley Haas and Wine & Spirit Education Trust, OSHA, a Markdown-based editor for class description formatting, color scheme changes, seat places remaining, and storage of recorded sessions.
