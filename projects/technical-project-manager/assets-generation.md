### Problem-solving for a sales application

I led a cross-departmental team, including leaders from five distinct departments and a senior engineering group, to build a custom app that had an initial budget of $80k with more allotted if the application increased sales. 

The application was intended to allow partners to generate bespoke, print-ready, co-branded materials on-site for their bars, restaurants, and liquor stores from approved marketing resources for each product SKU. 

The original scope of this project was around 300 assets; beyond the sheer volume of assets needed, we were not sure how to achieve this goal, as we needed to find or create a browser-based application that could build and preview 300-DPI CMYK color space assets. 

Sales and marketing wanted to have all assets upfront; I negotiated a smaller-scope project that focused on the three most impactful assets, with a technology spike for the engineers to figure out how to implement the project and at what cost.

I trained and managed a junior developer, who was responsible for building templates using HTML `grid` layouts and the css `@page` rule. 

I defined the project scope through a work breakdown structure, encompassing the work required to create hundreds of assets. We used this WBS as a negotiation tool to justify the need for a smaller and more manageable scope in two ways: first, it demonstrated that developing all the assets at once would far exceed budget and second, it helped stakeholders agree upon the need for a more reasonable scope.

#### Fail Fast 

In close collaboration with senior developers, I successfully balanced stakeholder expectations over this short project. I also performed a rigorous quality assurance process on the app, ensuring its effectiveness and reliability for those who used it on-site.

Ultimately, we developed menu inserts that were used by the sales people at local restaurants, however they proved less effective than anticipated. The company&rsquo;s design department had assets and templates they could use to quickly create branded assets, and it was determined that the on-site templates were not a significant value add and did not justify further development cost. Ultimately the project was closed under the initial budget. 

Thanks to collaboration and scope management, I saved the company money by letting this application fail fast.
