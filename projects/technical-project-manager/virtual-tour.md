### A VR your of a Cutting-Edge Campus

I served as the product owner for the creation of a $30K virtual tour of a $100M distillery. The team had never built a virtual tour before, and had no idea where to start. I spearheaded vendor procurement to find someone we trusted and could help guide us through the process. We adopted a progressively elaborated timeline, allowing us to evolve our understanding and tactics as the project unfolded, and in tandem with the vendor's guidance.

The tour provided detailed insights into the distillery's technical specifications, educational content about its history, and product information. This is a favorite project both for myself and my team, as we started out knowing so little about how to build a tour and created something that looks and functions great. This was thanks in large part to the vendor, and my ability to manage the content flow by collaborating with stakeholders.
