### xAPI & Prompt Engineering 

We conceived, designed, and launched an educational course built in Twine that instructs the learner how to leverage ChatGPT to construct more effective assessment questions. 

Using custom-built xAPI statements we collected over 3,000 learner activity data points which we aggregated in a dashboard on Veracity Learning's analytics platform. We built this with a team new to xapi and twine in under 6 weeks. 

Real-time analysis of this data will allow us to measure learning effectiveness and refine the course design based on how well learning outcomes are being met at each step in the course.
