### Introducing a #100M Distillery

I was instrumental in researching, evaluating, and formulating a comprehensive business plan for the Bently Heritage brand.

We worked with a marketing form onto bolster research and gain access to reports, but conducted much of our own in tandem with subject matter experts in the industry.

#### The Means of Production

Researching larger-sized competitors was mission-critical, and I was entrusted to research this. We needed to understand the distilling landscape â€” particularly, the *estate* distilling landscape: who owns their own farms within the market segment, and can produce sizable amounts of spirits? My research produced info on almost 3,000 distilleries nationwide and enabled our team to gain invaluable understanding of competitors.

I distilled the data into a small informational report for the executive team. 

#### Strategic Direction for Years to Come

This document, which encapsulated strategic direction, market analysis, operational structure, marketing plan, and financial projections served as a pivotal tool for executive team approval. I was a critical piece in assisting with the SWOT analysis as well as facilitating meetings where we worked to establish a cohesive brand identity. 

This document established a clear framework to guide the brand's future growth and profitability. The final guidebook was produced in close collaboration with the COO and marketing director, typeset by the designer, and used through the distillery's lifecycle.
