### Optimizing Decisions Over a Year-Long Closure

 I worked in close collaboration with various leaders to determine scope, timeline, and milestones for a divestment project that would occur over the course of three months, 6 months, or a year. Our aim was to close a plant safely while maximizing return on income within the shortest possible time frame.

To achieve this, I worked closely with subject manager experts to understand the scope of the project and milestones. As this was a distillery certain pieces of equipment needed leads and lags to be properly shut down and cleaned.

After creating detailed timelines for all three scenarios, I implemented a Smartsheet that automated budget calculations based on a variety of salary loadouts. I created this system with 100% customizable workforce load-outs that company leaders could use easily. This approach fostered collaboraiton and allowed us to forecast finances and make informed decisions. We saved the company on labor costs while giving them piece of mind that the closure could be achieved safely and within constraints.

#### Collaboration with Modern Tools

By using modern, collaborative, and user-friendly project tools I helped company leaders make value-driven decisions during a challenging transition phase. As a result, the plant successfully transitioned and realized a 200% return on income in a quarter of the initially anticipated timeframe. While this project was financial success, it demonstrates the power of effective collaboration and strategic decision-making.
