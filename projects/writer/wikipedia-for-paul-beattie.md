### The Legacy of Paul Beattie

I was hired to build a Wikipedia page for Bay Area artist Paul Beattie on the recommendation of an old client, as I had successfully navigated the difficult process of building new Wikipedia entries in the past. In order to ensure the article would be approved by the community, I worked with the family as well as researched the artist's work, focusing on secondary sources. 

While the family had ample primary sources, I knew that as a researcher and editor I must avoid synthesizing the bias of primary sources, such as material belonging the artist&rsquo;s daughters, into the entry. I also wanted to establish the notability of the subject. Along the way I explained this to the stakeholders, teaching them about Wikipedia's policies and conventions.

All told, I was able to provide 33 sources for the article, which was submitted and approved by the editorial volunteers.
