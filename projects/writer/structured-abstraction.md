### Helping give voice to a strong vision

I collaborated with the founders of a technology studio to help them articulate their vision and ethos as part of a major redesign of their site. We had several informational meetings where I listened to their thoughts and helped them brainstorm concepts. This content was published with their site&rsquo;s redesign, but it helps guide their business strategy.
