### Strategic Communications 

Developed content initiatives, and web strategies for internal and external web properties â€” including governance, change management, accessibility, and other priority items. 

The Office of Strategic Communications is the primary contact between the Laboratory, the news media and the public; I worked with all levels of management, program leaders, scientists, and administrative staff to shape and communicate institutional messaging to effectively reach stakeholders and a broad-base audience. I also:

1. Created original content and provided writing and editing services while coordinating a comprehensive range of communication products, including visually engaging presentations, memos, reports, external reviews, stakeholder briefings, and multimedia content.
1. Developed and refined messaging frameworks that reflect LLNL's mission and values.
1. Interpreted complex technical ideas or strategies into clear, accurate, and actionable items. 
1. Coordinated projects with multiple authors from concept through completion.
1. Contributed to the evaluation and implementation of new tools, technologies, and processes.
1. Transformed metrics into strategy.
