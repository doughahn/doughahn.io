### Design & Code for an Arts Website

With the freedom to both design and code this website, I decided to utilize the author's poem, *99 Names of Exile*, in a unique way. On the landing page, I overlaid the poem's 99 names over author's name, erasing his identity until they names are removed. I employed [GreenSock](https://greensock.com/) to randomize the the array of the "names" and the order in which they disappear, as demonstrated in the video below.

The typeface 'Mirza' was selected for its similarity to the font used in the author's chapbook, providing a consistent visual identity across platforms. As with numerous other projects, I implemented a custom setup of Craft CMS. This choice was driven by the author's desire for advanced content modeling capabilities, which Craft CMS excellently accommodates.
