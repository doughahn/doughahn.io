### Design & code for an poet&rsquo;s website

With the freedom to both design and code this website, I decided to utilize the author&rsquo;s poem, *99 Names of Exile*, in a dramatic way. On the landing page, I overlaid the poem&rsquo;s *&ldquo;99 Names of Exile&rdquo;* over the author&rsquo;s name, erasing his identity until the names that others have imposed upon him are removed. I employed [GreenSock](https://greensock.com/), a javascript animation toolset, to randomize the the array of the &rdquo;names&rdquo; and the order in which they disappear, as demonstrated in the video below.

The typeface [&ldquo;Mirza&rdquo;](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Mirza) was selected for its similarity to the font used in the author&rsquo;s chapbook, providing a consistent visual identity across platforms. As with numerous other projects, I implemented a custom setup of Craft CMS. This choice was driven by the author&rsquo;s desire for advanced and non-chronological content modeling capabilities, which Craft CMS is excellent at accommodating.
