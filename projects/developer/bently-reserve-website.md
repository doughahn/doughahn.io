### Content Control in the Venue's Hands

I played an integral role as developer and writer updating the website for a premier event venue, while collaborating with key stakeholders. Our platform of choice was the Craft CMS, which I tailored to create bespoke content models that precisely met the client's unique needs.

#### Pivoting to Conferences

One of the core components of this project was a lateral pivot from targeting wedding events to building out a business and conference center. As the old federal reserve building opf San Francisco, we made an effort to emphasize that many of the boardrooms were where the original Federal Reserveâ€™s Board of Directors met. In addition, the client partnered with SFMOMA's Artist Gallery Program to bring a modern sense of design to the place.

While building the CMS, I created entries for each form that fed to several places on the website, along with customizable capacities, image galleries, room featiures. amd layout configurations.

#### One Simple Goal

The core strategy of the site was to generate quality leads. Thus, iterated on the RFP form, A/B testing various configurations and ultimately arriving on a simplified form that helped drive quality leads.

We integrated the form with Salesforce CRM, to assist the sales team with building relationships and converting leads into sales.
