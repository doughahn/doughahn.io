### Showing off history, design, & tech

I served as the lead developer on the kiosks for several high-profile buildings in the San Francisco Bay Area and Tahoe region.

As the primary writer, I was tasked with researching building technologies, interviewing engineers and architects to translate their technical know-how to copy for the casual reader. 

To achieve this I worked closely with stakeholders, including executives, to understand their needs. I then created a map of the content in order to understand the architecture of the kiosks.

 When ready for handoff to design and UX, I organized [Page Description Diagrams](https://uxmag.com/articles/re-introducing-page-description-diagrams) based on stakeholder needs as a deliverable for designers. One important discovery was that we needed to prioritize navigation, as we believed users would need to navigate quickly to their points of interest in a nonlinear fashion. This was reflected in the PDDs:

The kiosks helped the buildings earn LEED credits; each of them earned LEED Silver CI certification. You can still find them in the Reserve, Farmers Bank, and the Distillery.
