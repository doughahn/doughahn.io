### Past Meets Future

I collaborated with principal architects and stakeholders to build a storytelling website  advanced features such as geothermal heating, solar energy, and historic preservation efforts. Partnering with designers, we built interactions that highlighted these technologies using subtle parallax effects and simple but effective interactivity. one thing the team agreed on is that less is more.

Our design team deliberately chose a retro-modern font to encapsulate the building's fusion of historic and contemporary elements. Additionally, we placed the project in context by integrating pertinent local history, further enhancing the storytelling aspect of the website.

Ultimately, this is one of my favorite designs as it embodies a truly green buildout that respects history and community. As a developer, I enjoy animations and parallax effects when they are done subtly and appropriately match the needs of the content.
