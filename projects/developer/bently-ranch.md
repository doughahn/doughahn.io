### A Snappy Site for a New Farm

Bently Ranch sought a website redesign to reflect their rebranding transition towards a farm-centric identity. I spearheaded the effort to streamline the site and infuse it with a modern voice and tone. Meanwhile, the design team embraced a minimalist aesthetic, invoking the ranch's expansive landscapes while paying tribute to its Old West heritage.

The site was developed using a custom theme built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static framework because the stakeholders did not anticipate needing updates, giving the website for a snappy user experience.

Hugo provided an optimal solution, maintaining the site's performance and ease of use.
