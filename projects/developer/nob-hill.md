### The top of Nob Hill

I drafted the content and coded the website for Bently Nob Hill, a luxury apartment tower in San Francisco&rsquo;s Nob Hill neighborhood.

The site is small in scope and the client does not offer many openings, so we decided to use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with [Tina](https://tina.io/docs/) to manage content as a static site. I built the custom theme for this, as well as implemented the headless CMS.
