### The Top of Nob Hill

I drafted the content and coded the website for the Bently Nob Hill, a luxury apartment tower in San Francisco's nob hill neighborhood.

The site is small in scope and the client dos not offer many openings, so we decided to use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with [Tina](https://tina.io/docs/) to manage content as a static site. I built the custom theme for this, as well as implemented the headless CMS.
