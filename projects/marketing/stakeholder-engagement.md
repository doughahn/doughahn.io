### Curating Goodwill with a Strategic Purpose

As the lead writer and strategist for a 4-year, $100M construction venture for Bently Enterprises, I had helped bring an ambitious startup's vision to life. Collaborating closely with company executives, leaders, and external firms, we were able to craft a compelling narrative to share with stakeholders.

Central to our strategy was the establishment of an estate grains spirits category in the state of Nevada to facilitate higher production volumes, a crucial part of the business plan given the large scale of the distillery compared to a typical craft operation. This initiative was aimed not only at boosting production capacity but also at driving regional job growth and preserving local history.

> Senate Bill 199 pioneered the creation of an "estate distillery" category. As per the stipulations, estate distilleries are required to source 85 percent of their raw materials from within their state, thus bolstering the local economy. This approach offers them the privilege of a higher production limit than that of other distilleries outlined in Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS).

To garner support for the passing of this Bill, we strategically emphasized the extensive benefits the distillery would bring to the region. Bently hosted events, which I helped publicize and maintain subscriber segments for. They underscored that investment in local grain cultivation would generate a multitude of job opportunities.

In 2017, Bently's hard-fought campaign paid off with the [successful passing of Senate Bill 199](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/NELIS/REL/79th2017/Bill/5071/Overview), paving the way for a new era of Nevada-based distillery operation.
