### Research-based, Collaborative Brand Identity

In a concerted effort with senior leadership, design, and marketing teams, I was instrumental in the creation of brand guidelines for Bently Heritage. The final guide was approved after careful consumer research, competitive research, and iterative refinement based on team feedback. Over the next 5 years it was a comprehensive resource for all brand-related decision making.

As part of this project, we conducted meetings with stakeholders to generate business concepts based on word banks, personas, and positioning.
