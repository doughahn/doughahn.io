### Building green community with fellow PMPs

As a member of the Project Management Institute&rsquo;s San Francisco Bay Area chapter, I engage with local community leaders to discover, plan, and execute stewardship events. I help source expert speakers for our initiatives, and ensure the smooth operation of our events. In addition, I pitch in with program functions such as maintaining the organization&rsquo;s web page and taking turns providing updates to the executive board.

I also [wite articles for the PMI newsletter](https://pmisfbac.org/blog/embracing-wellness--sustainability-in-project-management--16705) when needed. 

I&rsquo;ve brought my professional expertise into this role by refining and automating event processes using QR codes, Google Forms, and Google Sheets. I&rsquo;ve also introduced fun thematic trivia icebreaker games before our virtual events to encourage community camaraderie.

My work with the Sustainability Team allows me to make a meaningful impact in my local community while continuously expanding my own project management knowledge.
