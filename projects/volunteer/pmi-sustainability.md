### Building Green Community with Fellow PMPs

As a member of the Project Management Institute's San francisco Bay Area chapter, I engage with local community leaders discover, plan, and execute stewardship events. I help source expert speakers for our initiatives, and ensure the smooth operation of our virtual events. In addition, I pitch in with program functions such as maintaining its web page and taking turns providing updates to the executive board.

I also [wite articles for the PMI newsletter](https://pmisfbac.org/blog/embracing-wellness--sustainability-in-project-management--16705) when needed. 

I've brought my professional expertise into this role by refining check-in and event followup processes using QU codes and Google sheets. I've also introduced thematic trivia icebreaker games before our virtual events.

My work with the Sustainability Team allows me to make a meaningful impact while continuously expanding my own project management knowledge.
