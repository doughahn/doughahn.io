As the founder, editor, developer, and designer of a highly-regarded poetry journal, I've been leading its publication for over 15 years. The journal's website is maintained using a combination of JavaScript, CSS, Ruby, and the [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) static site generator. Middleman was chosen for its ability to build multiple indices at once.

All content is accessible and semantic on all screen sizes. *Sink Review* was founded on the ideal of close collaboration between artists, writersm and technologists. As such it has a typography-first layout that places the focus on the words above design. Further, it features custom html and layouts tailored specifically to present the poems in thei intended format, no matter how difficult the layout.

This bespoke attention has allowed our us to succeed at a variety of interesting projects, such as poems randomized with javascriopt and translations presented alongside their source text.

*Sink Review* has been running for 18 years, and while it's on hiatus for now I hope to find a new editorial eam to work with on its next inception. If so inclined can find my poem, *[Nostrum](https://sinkreview.org/sink-1/nostrum.html)*, within its covers.
