### Building an Inclusive gaming Community 

I fostered a local gaming community in San Francisco by building events and finding new venues for public, free tabletop games through the [Organized Play Foundation](https://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/), a global organization. I cold-called game store owners to pitch them on running game noghts at their locations. Before the Pandemic we were operating games at 5 locations in San Francisco, helpoing support local small businesses as part of a vibrant community. 

I trained a team of volunteers organize weekly public events at various locations, cultivating mutually beneficial relationships with venue owners, and creating resources to ensure successful events. Through the course of my time as a volunteer, I managed conflict in a way that educated community members and built a community that is welcoming to new players, especially those in the LGBTQ+ communities. 

Finally, I codified my knowledge by collaborating with other volunteers and authoring a [handbook](https://organizedplayfoundation.org/Lorespire/VO-Handbook) for managing and building communities, running events, trigger points for escalation, and conflict resolution tools and tactics.

#### Handoff to the Next Generation

After years of running the area, I decided it was time to step down. I trained my replacement and served to transition them in. They are doing things their own way but with a foundation of knowledge I provided; the community is thriving.
