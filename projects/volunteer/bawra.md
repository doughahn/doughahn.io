### Running Safe Events on the Bay

As a member of the [Bay Area Whaleboating Association](http://www.itcrowing.com/bawra/) I recruit and coordinate motorized vessels to support races in the San Francisco bay. My role entails ensuring that the fleet operates in a safe, fair, and efficient manner from getting vessels into the water through to the finish line.

At times this can mean coordinating with the Port of San francisco as well as private boating clubs in the San Francisco area.

Another member of the association was a process improvement person at a bank; we are both firm believers in process documentation and sharing knowledge, and have made efforts to document the oral history and knowledge of past races. I also built a lessons learned document for each event, based on retrospectives with the team. 

This is vital to the continuous improvement of the races, and provides insights for future planners. This role that brings together my passion for rowing, building communities, and my professional skills.
